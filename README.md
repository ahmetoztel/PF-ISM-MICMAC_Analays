# PF-ISM-MICMAC Analysis Tool

This repository provides a Python implementation of the PF-ISM-MICMAC methodology, which combines Picture Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (PF-ISM) with MICMAC (Matrice d‚ÄôImpacts Crois√©s Multiplication Appliqu√©e √† un Classement) analysis. It allows researchers and decision-makers to analyze complex systems involving uncertainty, ambiguity, and interdependencies among multiple factors.

## üìå Key Features

- Supports Picture Fuzzy linguistic evaluations
- Aggregates multiple expert opinions using a weighted geometric operator
- Calculates crisp decision matrix from fuzzy input
- Constructs initial and final reachability matrices
- Generates a hierarchical ISM structure (factor levels)
- Performs MICMAC analysis (driving vs. dependence power)
- Outputs:
  - `PF_ISM_MICMAC_Results.xlsx` ‚Äî All matrices and classification results
  - `MICMAC_Results.pdf` ‚Äî MICMAC scatter plot
  - `Factor_Levels.pdf` ‚Äî ISM-based factor hierarchy

## üìÅ Input Format

The script reads expert evaluations from an Excel file selected via a file dialog. The Excel file should include:

- A square matrix for each expert (factor √ó factor)
- All expert matrices stacked vertically (no empty rows/columns)
- Evaluations using predefined linguistic terms: 0‚Äì4 or 'R'

## üßÆ Linguistic Scale to Picture Fuzzy Values

| Linguistic Term | Membership | Indeterminacy | Non-membership |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0               | 0.10       | 0.00          | 0.85           |
| 1               | 0.25       | 0.05          | 0.60           |
| 2               | 0.50       | 0.10          | 0.40           |
| 3               | 0.75       | 0.05          | 0.10           |
| 4               | 0.90       | 0.00          | 0.05           |
| R (Refusal)     | 0.00       | 0.20          | 0.00           |
